Earth. It was discovered by Universe Explorer Potola in 2092. In the past two centuries it had rapidly developed to a Type-3 Civilised planet. The astral essence of its star, the sun, had played a vital role in the planet’s rise. 
Earthlings had utilised the massive deposits of Uranium, which was a major fuel for interstellar travel and a necessary component in the warp-engine technology. They had several million of their people working across the starry sky for the Universal Pan Human Alliance. They also had several warriors who had tempered their bodies using Astral essence helping in warfronts across galaxies.
Astral essence was the energy of stars, used to temper one’s body. People who cultivated it gained abilities to manipulate the laws of nature, and someone who reached the peak of cultivating essence could destroy entire universes. 
Most of the energy of the sun had been used by earthlings and now its vibrant core was visible. It was a big black mass which emanate a rich quality of Astral Essence. This essence nurtured the lands of the earth, making it rich in energy. Earth which was previously a low class planet could now be compared to a Supreme Cultivation land with numerous deposits of minerals and treasures tempered by the laws of the universe.
Word of this terranean wonder soon spread to every corner of the starry sky; and in no time at all, thousands of investors set their sights on planet earth. Earth, which was once a poor and low-grade planet, soon turned into a hub of trade and business. 
At first, it was smooth sailing. Infrastructure for mining minerals, finding treasures and meditating on astral essence was developed. Laws were put in place to enable the fair distribution of land. Different races from across universes cooperated peacefully in the using Earth’s resources. However, as time passed, the lust for power made inter galactic relationships tense, agreements and treaties were forgotten and killing to attain treasures & resources was high.

To prevent such a fallout over the mineral rich lands of Earth, the Universal Pan Human Alliance devised a plan to allocate land fairly. The available land would be sold to several investors across galaxies through an app developed by the Starry-Sky Network.

The app has 5 cities which are divided into 6 plots, each to be bought by Aetherial Energy. The person who buys the plot can cultivate the land/ mine for treasures or do anything they like. This will be very helpful to stop the blood-shed happening for the mineral rights of the rich - Earth. 

PS - For simulation purposes the app assigns 1000 aetherial energy to every user that registers, but if this app was made in real life then it would be connected to the energy bank/ deposit of the person who registered.
